<h2>Red Square - Красная Площадь</h2>

COMMENTS: The code below is for a two column layout with image on the left and text on the right.
The page is divided into 12 possible units. So in this example, the left column is 5 units wide and the right column is 7 units wide. This is done using the col-sm-5 and col-sm-7, which you can see below. 
If you want the image column and text column to be equal widths, change both col-sm entries to col-sm-6 each. You can try different numbers as long as the two numbers are equal to 12.
I've also included paragraph tags and bullet list tags in the text section, so you can see how they work.

   <p> Red Square is one of Russia’s most famous landmarks and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tourists come here every year to see the Kremlin walls, St Basil’s Cathedral and Lenin’s Mausoleum. The square originated as a slum until Prince Ivan III ordered the square to be cleared in the late 1400’s. The Red Square became infamous for hosting military parades during the Soviet era, most notably the parades of 7th November 1941 and 24th June 1945.</p>

<p> <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The ‘red’ in Red Square does not refer to the colour or communism. It derives from the word ‘krasny - красный’ which meant ‘beautiful’ in old Russian - however in contemporary Russian ‘krasny - красный’ means red. Hence the Red Square.</p>

    <p> Lake Baikal is one of the oldest lakes in the world, ageing at least 25 million years old. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is located in South-Central Russia near the city of Irkutsk.  During the summer, after the ice from the mountains has melted, the lake is so clear that it is possible to see up to 130 feet down. The lake contains 27 islands that are mostly uninhabited and a stunning array of flora and fauna.</p>

<p> <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The lake contains 20% of the world’s freshwater supply.</p>

Now using the dough hook, add the flour 1 cup at a time letting it blend into the dough before adding the next cup. (Add the last cup 1/2 cup at a time so you don't over-do it). You know you've added enough flour when the dough is no longer sticking to the walls of the bowl. I ended up adding 6 cups + 2 Tbsp but it could vary slightly depending on the flour you use.
